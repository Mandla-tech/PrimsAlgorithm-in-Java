# PrimsAlgorithm-in-Java
Prim's Algorithm is one greedy algorithm that can be utilized in finding the minimum spanning tree from a graph.
We can use this algoeithm in applying a solution to the 'traveling salesman problem, and in networking design generally 
among other areas [telecommunication networks] where the least cost in nodes would be evaluated for efficiency.
